Setup:
    * clarify during GCloud CLI install that you don't need to authenticate until the class (using service acct)
Spring Boot Lab:
    * Unclear how to get modal dialog for 'import gradle' (could be more clear re: project structure)
    * Context re: why are are using maven structure in a gradle project
Buildpack Lab:
    * More background on a builder / buildpack
Intro Deploy K8s lab:
    * Would be nice to have us cat `.kube/config` to see what's happening
    * breakdown of the various subsections of config, what they mean, and how they map to k8s objects
    * multiple labels are useful, but overloading name as a label was confusing
ConfigMap Lab:
    * Instructions to redeploy deployment.yaml weren't super obvious
